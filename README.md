bucaDiBeppo 🍝
welcome to bucaDiBeppo — the branch that smells like marinara, wraps itself in dough, and whispers in your ear: "everything’s fine, just vibe." this is where we handle things with flair, sprinkle creativity on every commit, and keep it all in line with the bebra-mini artillery spirit.

what's cookin'?
main ingredient: a little code, slightly soaked in chaos.
secret sauce: everything that pops into my head (yes, random noises included).
toppings: indie films, techno beats, and... quiet dreams of billiards.
kitchen rules 🍕
embrace the weirdness. we all do.
code like an Italian mama’s watching: carefully, but with passion.
if something breaks — you already know who’s the error handler here.
why does this exist?
why not, captain Jangir bebra-mini artilleryman? it’s just another step toward greatness. and yes, with zero unnecessary traveling.

fork it, pull it, or just peek and enjoy. viva bucaDiBeppo! 🍷
